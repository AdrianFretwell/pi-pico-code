# Rotary Encoder

This sub section contains details of a set of C language functions and structs that allows one or more rotary encoded to be "plugged in" to a project.

The encoders used are the inexpensive [PEC11 series](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/pec11.pdf).  These encoders also have a push button action
for a momentary switch.
